\section{Motivation and significance}

Qualification of fusion technology is reliant on simulations to predict the performance of components in extreme (e.g., thermal and electromagnetic) and untestable (e.g., fusion neutron fluxes) environments. Enabling the use of simulations for risk-informed decision making requires that they are validated over testable domains to reduce uncertainty when extrapolating into irradiated conditions. The cost of performing large-scale validation tests on a complex components such as a breeder blankets will be on the order of Â£M's. Therefore, significant cost and risk reduction can be achieved by maximising the information obtained from an optimised set of targeted experiments.

A key parameter of validation experiments is the deployment of sensor arrays to measure the components response. There are currently no software tools available that can simulate and optimise the placement of diverse arrays of sensors for multi-physics conditions with realistic constraints (e.g., cost, reliability, and accuracy). Such a tool would have immediate benefits for reducing costs of the experimental programme required to qualify fusion components such as the breeder blankets and divertors [REFs].

Simulation validation is a fundamental problem of scientific and engineering computing [REFS] and it is particularly challenging for the multi-physics environments components are subjected to in fusion reactors [REFs]. Experimental validation  

We are developing this software in parallel to a research programme focusing on .

We envisage multiple applications of `pyvale`: testing validation metrics with known ground truth while modelling systematic and random measurement errors.  

Here we describe the core sensor simulation engine of `pyvale`

  

TODO \cite{gaston_moose_2009}

%TODO
% - pyvale is important as it allows engineers to test and model sensor deployments analysing random and systematic errors.
% - pyvale is physics agnostic: a sensor samples a physical field which can be a scalar, vector or tensor field. Multiple sensor arrays
% - pyvale performs Monte-Carlo Simulation in line with the GUM
% - pyvale takes inspiration from the digital image correlation community where synthetic image deformation simulations have been key to understanding and mitigating
% - pyvale is cross platform and targeted for ease of use by experimental and simulation engineers (no need to build from source)
